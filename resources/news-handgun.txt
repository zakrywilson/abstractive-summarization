A 13-year-old year old girl is under arrest after allegedly posting messages on Facebook threatening to use a handgun at her school in western Colorado.
The girl was arrested Tuesday after students told administrators at Mount Garfield Middle School in Clifton about the posts. Mesa County Sheriff's Office says the girl posted images of a handgun but it hasn't been found so far.

The Daily Sentinel newspaper reports that school superintendent Steve Schultz told parents in an email that students reported the posts at the end of Monday's school day.

The arrest came on the same day that authorities announced that they had foiled a plot by two 16-year-old girls to harm students and staff members at their high school in Highlands Ranch.
