# Abstractive Summarization
Automatic abstractive summarization for articles

## How to use
* Download [CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml#Download) 
and [OpenIE](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.shtml#Download) from Stanford.edu.  
*Be sure to download the code and the modules for both!*
* Clone repo.
* Put all four JARS in repo.
* Run `make run` on command line.

## How it works
* Reads in file and extracts text.  
* Extracts information, displays it to screen, and writes it to file.
* Example:`"Bob likes puppies more than cats."`
  * Extracts triples: e.g., `[Bob | likes | puppies]`.
  * Extracts named entities: e.g., `Bob -> Person`.

###### Notes: 
* **This program is not finished** â€“ so far it only extracts the triples from the text.
* If you want change the input file, that can be changed in `Manager.java`.
* By default, output is sent to standard out and to a file: `<input_filename>-bsu.txt`.
