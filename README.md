# Abstractive Summarization
automatic abstractive summarization for news articles

## How to use
* Download [CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml#Download) 
and [OpenIE](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.shtml#Download) from Stanford.edu.  
Be sure to download both code and modules JARs for CoreNLP and OpenIE.
* Clone repo.
* Add all four JARs to your classpath.
* Run `Manager.java`.

## How it works
* Reads in file and extracts text.  
* Extracts information, displays it to screen, and writes it to file.
* Example:`"Bob likes puppies more than cats."`
  * Extracts triples: `[Bob | likes | puppies]`
  * Extracts named entities: `Bob -> Person`
* Removes semantic information with low confidence scores.
* Removes sentences that were not assigned triples or had all of their triples removed.

###### Notes: 
* **This program is not finished** â€“ so far it only extracts triples from the text.
* If you want change the input file, that can be changed in `Manager.java`.
* Store input text files in `resources/`.
* By default, output is sent to standard out and to a file: `originalfilename-bsu.txt`.
